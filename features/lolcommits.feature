    And the exit status should be 1

  @simulate-env
  Scenario: Commiting in an enabled repo triggers successful capture
    Given a git repository named "testcapture"

    When I cd to "testcapture"
    And I successfully run `lolcommits --enable`
    And I successfully run `git add .`
    And I successfully run `git commit -m 'can haz commit'`
    Then the output should contain "*** Preserving this moment in history."
    And a directory named "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/testcapture" should exist
    And a file named "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/testcapture/tmp_snapshot.jpg" should not exist
    And there should be 1 jpg in "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/testcapture"

  @simulate-env @focus
  Scenario: Commiting in an enabled repo subdirectory triggers successful capture of parent repo
    Given a git repository named "testcapture"
    And a directory named "testcapture/subdir"
    And an empty file named "testcapture/subdir/FOOBAR"

    And I successfully run `git commit -m 'can haz commit'`
    Then the output should contain "*** Preserving this moment in history."
    And a directory named "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/subdir" should not exist
    And a directory named "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/testcapture" should exist
    And a file named "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/testcapture/tmp_snapshot.jpg" should not exist
    And there should be 1 jpg in "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/testcapture"

  @simulate-env
  Scenario: Configuring Plugin
    Given a git repository named "config-test"
    When I cd to "config-test"
    And I run `lolcommits --configure` and wait for output
    And I enter "loltext" for "Plugin Name"
    And I enter "true" for "enabled"
    Then I should be presented "Successfully Configured"
    And a file named "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/config-test/config.yml" should exist
    When I successfully run `lolcommits --show-config`
    Then the output should contain "loltext:"
    And the output should contain "enabled: true"
    
  @simulate-env
  Scenario: Configuring Plugin In Test Mode
    Given a git repository named "testmode-config-test"
    When I cd to "testmode-config-test"
    And I run `lolcommits --configure --test` and wait for output
    And I enter "loltext" for "Plugin Name"
    And I enter "true" for "enabled"
    Then I should be presented "Successfully Configured"
    And a file named "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/test/config.yml" should exist
    When I successfully run `lolcommits --test --show-config`
    Then the output should contain "loltext:"
    And the output should contain "enabled: true"

  @simulate-env
  Scenario: test capture should work regardless of whether in a git repository
    Given a directory named "nothingtoseehere"
    When I cd to "nothingtoseehere"
    And I run `lolcommits --test --capture`
    Then the output should contain "*** Capturing in test mode."
    And the output should not contain "path does not exist (ArgumentError)"
    And the exit status should be 0 

  @simulate-env
  Scenario: test capture should store in its own test directory
    Given a git repository named "randomgitrepo"
    When I cd to "randomgitrepo"
    And I successfully run `lolcommits --test --capture`
    Then a directory named "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/test" should exist
    And a directory named "tmp/aruba/.lolcommits/randomgitrepo" should not exist

  @wip
  Scenario: last command should work properly when in a lolrepo
    Given a git repository named "randomgitrepo"
    And a loldir named "randomgitrepo" with 2 lolimages
    And I cd to "randomgitrepo"
    When I run `lolcommits --last`
    Then the exit status should be 0

  @wip
  Scenario: last command should fail gracefully if not in a lolrepo
    Given a git repository named "randomgitrepo"
    And a loldir named "randomgitrepo" with 2 lolimages
    And I cd to "randomgitrepo"
    When I run `lolcommits --last`
    Then the output should contain "There can't be any lolcommits since you are not in a git repository!"
    Then the exit status should be 1

  @wip
  Scenario: last command should fail gracefully if zero lolimages in lolrepo
    Given a git repository named "randomgitrepo"
    And a loldir named "randomgitrepo" with 2 lolimages
    And I cd to "randomgitrepo"
    When I run `lolcommits --last`
    Then the output should contain "No lolcommits have been captured for this repository yet."
    Then the exit status should be 1
