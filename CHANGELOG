0.0.3 (16 April 2012)
  * use only first line for multi-line commit msgs (pull req #21)
  * clean up some command line options

0.0.2 (2 April 2012)
  * add --delay option to delay image capture (thx JohanB), can be
  persistently set via LOLCOMMITS_DELAY environment variable.
  * add --last command to view most recent lolcommit for a repo
  * add --browse command to open the lolcommit images directory for a particular repo

0.0.1 (29 March 2012)
  * initial release as a gem package, major refactoring for this
  * refactored to remove git-hooks package dependency, now installs stub hook
  directly into each git repo
  * wordwrap commit_msg manually, to switch to use imagemagick annotate
  instead of compositing multiply image Caption objects (this seems to be more
  reliable to not glitch.)
